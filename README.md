# Build a Task Management Dashboard
##  Technical Requirements

-  React + TypeScript:

-  Use functional components.
-  Strictly type your components, state, and actions.
###  State Management:

-  Use Context API and useReducer for managing tasks globally.
-  Include actions like
    -    ADD_TASK,
    -    EDIT_TASK,
    -    DELETE_TASK,
    -    and FILTER_TASKS.
-  UI/Styling:

  -  Use MUI for consistent and professional design.
  -  Add a dark mode toggle as a bonus feature.
###  Testing:

  -  Write unit tests for key components using Jest and React Testing Library.
####  Test the following:
  -  Adding a task.
  -  Editing a task.
  -  Deleting a task.
  -  Filtering tasks.
####  Performance:

  -  Use React.memo, useMemo, or useCallback to optimize components prone to unnecessary re-renders.
