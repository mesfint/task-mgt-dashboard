# Build a Task Management Dashboard
    
##    Create a simple Task Management Dashboard with the following features:

    -    <b>Task List:</b> Display all tasks, categorized by status (To-Do, In Progress, Completed).
    -    Add Task: Allow users to add new tasks.
    -    Edit Task: Let users edit task details (e.g., title, description, and status).
    -    Delete Task: Remove tasks from the list.
    -    Persist Data: Use localStorage to persist tasks across page reloads.
    -    Context + Reducer: Manage the global state using Context and useReducer.
    -    Filtering: Provide buttons or dropdowns to filter tasks by their status.
    -    Responsive Design: Ensure the app is mobile-friendly and visually appealing.
    
##  Technical Requirements

-  React + TypeScript:

-  Use functional components.
-  Strictly type your components, state, and actions.
###  State Management:

-  Use Context API and useReducer for managing tasks globally.
-  Include actions like
    -    ADD_TASK,
    -    EDIT_TASK,
    -    DELETE_TASK,
    -    and FILTER_TASKS.
-  UI/Styling:

  -  Use MUI for consistent and professional design.
  -  Add a dark mode toggle as a bonus feature.
###  Testing:

  -  Write unit tests for key components using Jest and React Testing Library.
####  Test the following:
  -  Adding a task.
  -  Editing a task.
  -  Deleting a task.
  -  Filtering tasks.
####  Performance:

  -  Use React.memo, useMemo, or useCallback to optimize components prone to unnecessary re-renders.
